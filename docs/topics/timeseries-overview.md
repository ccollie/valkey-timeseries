# Valkey TimeSeries Overview

Valkey TimeSeries is a module for [Valkey](https://valkey.io) that adds a high-performance, in-memory time series data
type. It is designed to handle high-velocity ingestion and real-time querying of metric data, leveraging the speed of
memory and the
versatility of the Valkey ecosystem. The API is a superset of RedisTimeSeries, offering compatibility with existing
tools while
providing optimizations for Valkey.

## Use Cases

The module is architected for scenarios requiring low-latency storage and retrieval of time-stamped numerical data:

* **Application Monitoring:** Storage of metrics from servers, containers, or distributed applications (CPU, memory,
  latency).
* **IoT Telemetry:** Ingesting sensor data from edge devices with high throughput.
* **Real-time Analytics:** Calculation of moving averages, max/min values, and aggregating data streams for dashboards.
* **Financial Data:** Storing tick data, price history, or trading volume for rapid analysis.

## Supported Commands

The command set generally follows the `TS.<COMMAND>` pattern and is case-insensitive.

### Management

* `TS.CREATE`: Create a new time series with specific retention, encoding, and chunk size policies.
* `TS.ALTER`: Modify the configuration of an existing series.
* `TS.INFO`: Retrieve detailed information and statistics about a specific time series.

### Ingestion

* `TS.ADD`: Append a new sample (timestamp, value) to a series.
* `TS.MADD`: Append samples to multiple series atomically.
* `TS.ADDBULK`: Append multiple samples to a single series in one command.
* `TS.INCRBY` / `TS.DECRBY`: Increment or decrement the value of the latest sample.
* `TS.DEL`: Delete samples within a specific time range.

### Querying

* `TS.GET`: Retrieve the last sample of a series.
* `TS.MGET`: Retrieve the last sample from multiple series matching a filter.
* `TS.RANGE`: Query a range of samples from a single series.
* `TS.MRANGE`: Query ranges across multiple series based on filters.

### Compaction & Rules

* `TS.CREATERULE`: Create a downsampling rule to aggregate data from a source key to a destination key over fixed time
  buckets.
* `TS.DELETERULE`: Remove an existing compaction rule.

## Indexes

Valkey TimeSeries uses a label-based indexing system separate from the key space.

* **Labels:** Every time series can be associated with a set of `field=value` labels (e.g., `region=us-east`,
  `env=prod`).
* **Secondary Indexing:** These labels form a secondary index that allows for efficient discovery of keys. Unlike
  standard Valkey keys which are accessed by the exact name, time series can be grouped and queried dynamically.
* **Cardinality:** Commands like `TS.CARD` provide insights into the cardinality of the index to help monitor memory
  usage and query efficiency.

`valkey-timeseries` maintains a per-node, per-database inverted index to map labels to series.
Query expressions are constructed like a filter that uses the data in the columns to identify keys. The actual
implementation is
based on an inverted index, not linear filtering. Each Valkey database has a separate namespace of indexes.

Indexes exist separate from the Valkey database. Updates of the database trigger updates of one or more indexes which
are done by background threads. Query operations are also performed by background threads optionally switching to the
main thread to access the Valkey database. The consistency model between these two domains is further described below.
Applications don't directly put data into an index, rather mutation operations on keys within the declared keyspace of
an index automatically update the index with the labels of that key.

# Index Replication

Indexes are node-local. Each node, regardless of whether it's a primary or a replica, maintains its own index
independently. Indexes on replicas are updated by key mutations transmitted on the replication channel and thus are
subject to replication lag just like the Valkey database itself.

## Querying

Data retrieval is highly flexible, supporting filtering, aggregation, and arithmetic operations.

* **Filtering:** Queries use label matchers (e.g., `TS.MRANGE ... FILTER region=us-east metric!=cpu`) to select the
  target series.
* **Aggregation:** Raw samples can be aggregated at query time using functions such as `avg`, `sum`, `min`, `max`,
  `count`, `first`, `last`, `std.p`, `std.s`, var.p`, `var.s`, and `twa` (Time Weighted Average).
* **Alignment:** Time buckets can be aligned to specific intervals to ensure consistent reporting across different
  series.

# Cluster Mode

Timeseries fully supports cluster mode and uses Valkey's cluster bus and protobuf for intra-cluster communication.

In cluster mode, Valkey distributes keys according to the hash algorithm of the keyname. This placement of data is not
affected by the presence of the timeseries module or any timeseries indexes. Since timeseries commands operate at the
index level -- not the key level -- timeseries is responsible for dealing with the distribution of data, performing
intra-cluster RPC to execute commands as needed. Thus, the application interface to valkey-timeseries operates the same
in cluster and non-cluster mode.

Timeseries uses a simple architecture where index definitions are replicated on every node, but the corresponding index
only
contains the data which is co-resident on that node. Index update operations remain wholly local to a node and will
scale horizontally (save/restore operations also wholly node local). Vertical scaling is also effective because of the
multithreaded architecture.

Query operations are performed by one node of each shard on its local index, and the results are transparently merged to
form a full command response. Query operations are subject to increasing overhead as the cluster shard count increases,
meaning that query operations may scale sub-linearly with increasing shard count.


## Index Consistency

The TimeSeries architecture relies on having identical index definitions distributed across the cluster. The protocol
relies on a Merkle-tree checksum of all indexes defined on a node being broadcast over the cluster bus periodically.
Nodes which discover a mismatch in the checksum contact each other and negotiate a resolution using version numbers and
last-writer-wins timestamps, one index at a time. If a node loses the negotiation for an index, it will delete its
version of the index and recreate it using the winning definition.

On top of the eventual consistency machinery, the individual commands also perform additional consistency checks on the
involved index, typically retrying operations until consistency is achieved or a timeout occurs, terminating the command
with a consistency error message.

The commands operate by mutating the local copy of the metadata and then triggering the convergence protocol. The most
likely cause of failure is a shard-down or network partition situation.

The `TS.INFO` command has options that allow aggregation of index statistics and status across the cluster.

## Query Consistency

The query operations: `TS.MRANGE` and other multi-shard aggregation queries can only be executed by nodes that share the
same index definition and slot ownership map. Cross-shard query commands contain a checksum of the coordinator's index
definition and slot ownership. If a receiving node's index checksum or slot ownership checksum mismatches then the query
is rejected and the coordinator will retry the operation. If a timeout occurs, then by default an error is returned and
the client must retry once the cluster has converged to a consistent state.
