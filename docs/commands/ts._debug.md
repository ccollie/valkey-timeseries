# TS._DEBUG

Internal diagnostic and introspection tool for the valkey-timeseries module.

> **Note:** `TS._DEBUG` is intended for operators and developers. Its subcommands, output formats, and behavior may
> change between versions without notice. Do not rely on this command in production application logic.

## Enabling

`TS._DEBUG` is disabled by default. Every subcommand is rejected until the `debug-mode`
configuration parameter is enabled:

```
TS._DEBUG HELP
(error) TSDB: TS._DEBUG is disabled. Set the 'ts.debug-mode' configuration parameter to yes to enable it
```

Enable it at runtime:

```
CONFIG SET ts.debug-mode yes
```

or at startup, as a module load argument (unprefixed there — the `ts.` prefix applies only to
`CONFIG GET`/`CONFIG SET`):

```
loadmodule /path/to/libvalkey_timeseries.so debug-mode yes
```

The setting takes effect immediately and can be turned back off with `CONFIG SET ts.debug-mode no`.

## Syntax

````aiignore
TS._DEBUG <subcommand> [arguments]</subcommand>
````

## Subcommands

| Subcommand        | Description                                             |
|-------------------|---------------------------------------------------------|
| `HELP`            | Display available subcommands and brief descriptions    |
| `STATS`           | Report this node's module metrics, or reset them        |
| `STRINGPOOLSTATS` | Report statistics for the global string interning pool  |
| `INDEXMEMORY`     | Report the label index's heap footprint (fields as in `INFO ts_memory`) |
| `INFLIGHT`        | List this node's fan-out requests still waiting on peers |
| `QUERYINDEX`      | Query this node's local index only, without cluster fan-out |
| `LIST_CONFIGS`    | List module configuration parameters and current values |
| `PANIC_NEXT_ANALYSIS_JOB` | Make the next background analysis job (`TS.OUTLIERS` on a large range) panic, to test that its client still gets an error reply |

### Reply protocol

Replies made of named fields are RESP3 maps. A RESP2 client gets the same pairs as a flat array
of alternating keys and values, in the same order. Over RESP2, doubles arrive as bulk strings.

Field names are camelCase, like `TS.INFO`'s. Sizes are in bytes, and a percentage (0–100) ends in
`Pct`; any other unit is named at the end of the field (`ageMs`). Metric names in `STATS` are not
field names but [OpenMetrics](https://prometheus.io/docs/practices/naming/) identifiers,
snake_case with a unit suffix (`_seconds`, `_bytes`) and `_total` on counters. They are the same
everywhere a metric appears, including the `name` field of a `VERBOSE` entry.

### Cluster scope

Every subcommand reports, or acts on, the node you are connected to. `STATS`, `STATS RESET`,
`STRINGPOOLSTATS` and `INDEXMEMORY` also take a `CLUSTER` keyword, which fans the request out
and combines the answers as each subcommand describes. Every node asked must have `debug-mode`
enabled, or the command fails. On a standalone server `CLUSTER` is an error
(`TSDB: CLUSTER requires cluster mode`), so a given request always gets the same reply layout.

---

### TS._DEBUG HELP

Displays the available `TS._DEBUG` subcommands and their descriptions.

### Syntax

```bash
TS._DEBUG HELP
```

### Return Value

A map from each command synopsis to its description.

### Example

```
TS._DEBUG HELP
```

```
 1) "TS._DEBUG STATS [section ...] [VERBOSE] [CLUSTER]"
 2) "Show this node's module metrics, optionally for the named sections only (VERBOSE adds kind and description); CLUSTER sums counters and histograms over every node and lists gauges per node"
 3) "TS._DEBUG STATS RESET [CLUSTER]"
 4) "Start this node's metric counters and histograms over (gauges are left alone), or every node's with CLUSTER"
 ...
```

---

### TS._DEBUG STATS

Reports module metrics: events that happen inside a command or in background work, which the
server's own `INFO commandstats` / `latencystats` cannot see. Counters are collected whether or
not `debug-mode` is on; only reading them needs it.

Each node counts what happens on it, and `STATS` reports the connected node's metrics. With
`CLUSTER` the command fans out to every node, replicas included, and combines their metrics:
counters and histograms are summed, and each gauge's value becomes a map with one value per node
(summing refresh intervals or queue depths across nodes would hide which node they describe).
Every node must have `debug-mode` enabled, or a `CLUSTER` request fails.

The cluster view counts itself: the fan-out that collects it is an operation on the coordinator,
like any other. A reply is not an atomic snapshot, on one node or across nodes: two values may
straddle an update.

### Syntax

```bash
TS._DEBUG STATS [section ...] [VERBOSE] [CLUSTER]
TS._DEBUG STATS RESET [CLUSTER]
```

### Arguments

| Argument  | Required | Description                                                                                   |
|-----------|----------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| `section` | No       | Report only these sections (case-insensitive, repeatable). An unknown name is an error that lists the valid ones |
| `VERBOSE` | No       | Report each metric's section, kind and description alongside its value                         |
| `RESET`   | No       | Start the connected node's counters and histograms over from zero. Gauges are left alone. Takes no other argument but `CLUSTER` |
| `CLUSTER` | No       | Report (or reset) every node, replicas included, instead of the connected one. An error on a standalone server |

### Return Value

**Without `VERBOSE`:** a map from metric name to value, in a fixed order
(by section, then by name within a section). Counters are integers; gauges are integers, or doubles when
the unit is fractional (seconds). A histogram's value is a map:

| Field     | Type    | Description                                                                         |
|-----------|---------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| `count`   | integer | Number of observations                                                              |
| `sum`     | double  | Sum of the observations, in the metric's unit                                       |
| `buckets` | array   | `[le, count]` pairs for the finite bounds; `le` is a double, `count` is cumulative (observations `<= le`) |

The `+Inf` bucket is not listed: its count is `count`.

**With `CLUSTER`** the layout is the same, except that a gauge's value is a
map from node address (`host:port`) to value, one entry per node, sorted by address.
Counters and histogram counts are summed over the nodes. A histogram whose buckets differ from the others' (a node on another version) is left out of the sum, with a warning in
that coordinator's log. Duration histograms are in seconds,
with 24 bounds at powers of two from 1 µs (`0.000001`) to 2²³ µs (about 8.4 s).

**With `VERBOSE`:** an array with one map of 5 fields per metric:
`name`, `section`, `kind` (`counter`, `gauge` or `histogram`), `value`, `description`.

**`RESET`:** `OK`.

### Metrics

Names follow OpenMetrics conventions: counters end in `_total`, and a unit suffix names the
unit (durations are in seconds).

`RESET` does not change the values underneath, which only ever increase (as a Prometheus-style
scraper expects). It records them as a baseline, and `STATS` reports counters and histograms
relative to it.

Metrics are grouped in sections; each name starts with its section.

#### `clustermap`

The cluster map fan-outs choose their targets from. Empty-handed on a standalone server: the
counters stay at zero, `refresh_interval_seconds` at 0 and `age_seconds` at -1.

| Name | Kind | Description |
|------|------|-------------|
| `clustermap_refreshes_total` | counter | Rebuilds from `CLUSTER NODES`, whatever their outcome |
| `clustermap_refresh_changed_total` | counter | Rebuilds that published a new map |
| `clustermap_refresh_unchanged_total` | counter | Rebuilds that found the topology unchanged (expiry extended) |
| `clustermap_refresh_failures_total` | counter | Rebuilds that failed, leaving the previous map in place |
| `clustermap_forced_refreshes_total` | counter | Rebuilds forced by a peer request carrying a different fingerprint |
| `clustermap_stale_marks_total` | counter | Times a peer's cluster-map mismatch error marked this node's map stale |
| `clustermap_refresh_interval_seconds` | gauge | Current adaptive refresh interval (doubles while the topology is stable, up to 5 s) |
| `clustermap_age_seconds` | gauge | Time since the map was last built or confirmed unchanged |

#### `cron`

| Name | Kind | Description |
|------|------|-------------|
| `cron_interval_seconds` | gauge | Time between cron ticks, derived from the server's `hz` (a double) |
| `cron_tick_duration_seconds` | histogram | Main-thread time per cron tick spent dispatching background tasks |
| `cron_ticks_total` | counter | Cron ticks that ran the background-task scheduler |
| `cron_ticks_skipped_total` | counter | Cron ticks skipped because the server was loading or shutting down |

#### `exec`

| Name | Kind | Description |
|------|------|-------------|
| `exec_fanout_queued` | gauge | Jobs waiting for a worker on the `ts-fanout-request` lane (peer requests and local fan-out shares) |
| `exec_fanout_running` | gauge | Jobs a worker is running on the `ts-fanout-request` lane |
| `exec_fanout_rejected_total` | counter | Jobs refused because the `ts-fanout-request` queue was full (answered as busy) |
| `exec_analysis_queued` | gauge | Jobs waiting for a worker on the `ts-analysis` lane |
| `exec_analysis_running` | gauge | Jobs a worker is running on the `ts-analysis` lane |
| `exec_analysis_rejected_total` | counter | Jobs refused because the `ts-analysis` queue was full |

#### `fanout`

Counted on the node where the event happens: operations, timeouts and shard errors on the
coordinator; `served_*` and `rejected_*` on the peer answering it; message and byte counts on
the sender. A fan-out whose only target is the coordinator itself is an operation (and
`local_only`) but sends nothing.

As coordinator:

| Name | Kind | Description |
|------|------|-------------|
| `fanout_operations_total` | counter | Fan-out operations started, one per command that fans out |
| `fanout_targets_total` | counter | Targets of those operations, the local node included |
| `fanout_local_only_total` | counter | Operations whose only target was this node (no RPC) |
| `fanout_duration_seconds` | histogram | Time from the start of an operation to its result |
| `fanout_inflight` | gauge | RPCs with remote shares outstanding (see `TS._DEBUG INFLIGHT`) |
| `fanout_errors_<kind>_total` | counter | Shard errors by kind, the local share included. Kinds: `invalid_message`, `node_unreachable`, `timeout`, `unknown_message_type`, `permissions`, `key_permissions`, `serialization`, `bad_request_id`, `internal`, `cluster_map_mismatch`, `unsupported_features`, `invalid_db`, `busy`, `custom` |
| `fanout_aborts_total` | counter | Operations ended early by an error returned as it is: a cluster-map mismatch, a permission denial, a busy shard |
| `fanout_generic_error_replies_total` | counter | Operations answered with the generic "Internal error in fanout operation" reply after a shard failed with another kind |
| `fanout_client_timeouts_total` | counter | Blocked clients answered with the timeout error |
| `fanout_rpc_timeouts_total` | counter | RPCs whose timer fired with remote shares outstanding |
| `fanout_setup_failures_total` | counter | Operations that failed before any remote request was sent |
| `fanout_blocking_denied_total` | counter | Commands refused because the client could not be blocked (MULTI, a script, a module call) |
| `fanout_send_failures_total` | counter | Requests the cluster bus refused to send |
| `fanout_local_share_busy_total` | counter | Local shares refused because the fan-out lane's queue was full |
| `fanout_local_share_expired_total` | counter | Local shares that waited in the queue past the deadline |
| `fanout_error_decode_failures_total` | counter | Error responses from peers that could not be decoded |
| `fanout_ignored_unknown_request_total` | counter | Peer answers dropped because their request is no longer in flight (it timed out, say) |
| `fanout_ignored_unknown_sender_total` | counter | Peer answers dropped because their sender is not a remote target of the request |
| `fanout_ignored_duplicate_total` | counter | Peer answers dropped because their sender had already answered |
| `fanout_ignored_after_completion_total` | counter | Shard answers dropped because the operation had already completed (after an abort, say) |
| `fanout_pushdown_fallback_series_total` | counter | `TS.MRANGE` series aggregated on the coordinator because their shard ignored aggregation push-down (an older peer) |
| `fanout_pushdown_group_fallback_series_total` | counter | `TS.MRANGE` series reduced on the coordinator because their shard ignored group-reduce push-down |

One timed-out fan-out usually counts once in both `client_timeouts` and `rpc_timeouts` (whichever
deadline reaches the client first wins), so don't add them. Local-only fan-outs have no RPC, so
only `client_timeouts` can count them.

As a peer serving a coordinator:

| Name | Kind | Description |
|------|------|-------------|
| `fanout_served_ok_total` | counter | Requests served successfully |
| `fanout_served_errors_total` | counter | Requests whose handler failed (answered with an error response) |
| `fanout_reply_send_failures_total` | counter | Successful answers the cluster bus refused to send back |
| `fanout_rejected_parse_total` | counter | Requests that could not be parsed |
| `fanout_rejected_unsupported_features_total` | counter | Requests demanding envelope features this node lacks |
| `fanout_rejected_no_handler_total` | counter | Requests for an operation this node has no handler for |
| `fanout_rejected_busy_total` | counter | Requests refused because the fan-out lane's queue was full |
| `fanout_rejected_cluster_map_mismatch_total` | counter | Requests rejected because the sender's cluster map disagrees with this node's |

On the wire (counted by the sender):

| Name | Kind | Description |
|------|------|-------------|
| `fanout_requests_sent_total` | counter | Requests sent to peers, one per peer |
| `fanout_request_sent_bytes_total` | counter | Payload bytes of those requests |
| `fanout_responses_sent_total` | counter | Responses sent back to coordinators |
| `fanout_response_sent_bytes_total` | counter | Payload bytes of those responses |
| `fanout_error_responses_sent_total` | counter | Error responses sent back to coordinators |
| `fanout_error_response_sent_bytes_total` | counter | Payload bytes of those error responses |

The byte counts are the payloads this node handed to the cluster bus: the bus's own framing is
not included, and a fan-out's local share never crosses the bus.

### Examples

```
TS._DEBUG STATS cron
```

```
1) "cron_interval_seconds"
2) "0.1"
3) "cron_tick_duration_seconds"
4) 1) "count"
   2) (integer) 1843
   3) "sum"
   4) "4.16291e-4"
   5) "buckets"
   6)  1) 1) "0.000001"
          2) (integer) 512
       ...
5) "cron_ticks_total"
6) (integer) 1843
7) "cron_ticks_skipped_total"
8) (integer) 0
```

Start a clean window, then read one section with descriptions:

```
TS._DEBUG STATS RESET
TS._DEBUG STATS exec VERBOSE
```

---

### TS._DEBUG INFLIGHT

Lists the fan-out requests this node is coordinating that still wait on remote shards, oldest
first. The tool for "a fan-out is hung": which command, how long, how many peers have yet to
answer.

### Syntax

```bash
TS._DEBUG INFLIGHT
```

### Return Value

An array with one map of 5 fields per request:

| Field           | Type    | Description                                                             |
|-----------------|---------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| `id`            | string  | The request id (a string: ids span the full unsigned 64-bit range)      |
| `command`       | string  | The fan-out operation, such as `mrange`                                 |
| `ageMs`         | integer | Milliseconds since the request was sent                                 |
| `remoteTargets` | integer | Peers the request was sent to                                           |
| `outstanding`   | integer | Peers that have not answered yet                                        |

Node-local: a request is in flight only on the node coordinating it. A fan-out whose only target
is this node never appears (it has no remote request), and a request leaves the list as soon as
its timeout fires. On a standalone server the list is always empty.

---

### TS._DEBUG STRINGPOOLSTATS

Returns memory usage and efficiency statistics for the global string interning pool. The pool deduplicates repeated
label names and values across all time series.

The command reports the pool of the node you are connected to. With `CLUSTER` it fans out to one
primary per shard and sums their pools; every primary must have `debug-mode` enabled, or the
command fails. See **With `CLUSTER`** below for how the sums read.

### Syntax

```bash
TS._DEBUG STRINGPOOLSTATS [k] [CLUSTER]
```

### Arguments

| Argument | Type    | Required | Description                                                                             |
|----------|---------|----------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| `k`      | integer | No       | If provided and greater than `0`, include top-K entries ranked by ref count and by size |
| `CLUSTER` | keyword | No      | Sum every shard primary's pool instead of reporting this node's. An error on a standalone server |

### Return Value

Without `k` (or `k = 0`), returns an array of 4 elements:

| Index | Name            | Description                                                               |
|-------|-----------------|---------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| 0     | `GlobalStats`   | Aggregate statistics across all interned strings (see **BucketStats**)    |
| 1     | `ByRefcount`    | Array of `[refCount, BucketStats]` pairs, grouped by external ref count   |
| 2     | `BySize`        | Array of `[size, BucketStats]` pairs, grouped by string byte length       |
| 3     | `MemorySavings` | Estimated bytes and percentage saved by interning (see **MemorySavings**) |

When `k > 0`, two additional elements are appended:

| Index | Name         | Description                                                            |
|-------|--------------|------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| 4     | `TopKByRef`  | Top-K interned strings by external reference count (see **TopKEntry**) |
| 5     | `TopKBySize` | Top-K interned strings by allocated byte size (see **TopKEntry**)      |

#### BucketStats fields

Each `BucketStats` entry is a map of 6 fields:

| Field          | Type    | Description                                              |
|----------------|---------|----------------------------------------------------------|
| `count`        | integer | Number of distinct interned strings in this bucket       |
| `bytes`        | integer | Total logical byte length of strings in this bucket      |
| `avgSize`      | float   | Average logical byte length per string                   |
| `allocated`    | integer | Total allocated memory (including Arc overhead) in bytes |
| `avgAllocated` | float   | Average allocated memory per string                      |
| `utilizationPct` | integer | Ratio of used bytes to allocated bytes, as a percentage |

#### MemorySavings fields

A map of 6 fields:

| Field               | Type    | Description                                                                    |
|---------------------|---------|--------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| `memorySavedBytes`  | integer | Bytes saved by sharing interned strings across multiple references             |
| `memorySavedPct`    | float   | `memorySavedBytes` as a share of the pool's cost without interning             |
| `holders`           | integer | Live references to interned strings, one per outstanding slot                  |
| `holderSlotBytes`   | integer | Bytes those references spend on slots (8 bytes each), with or without interning |
| `totalStorageBytes` | integer | What interned strings cost in total: pool `allocated` plus `holderSlotBytes`   |
| `storageSavedPct`   | float   | `memorySavedBytes` as a share of `totalStorageBytes` without interning         |

The two percentages answer different questions and the gap between them is often wide.

`memorySavedPct` counts only heap allocations on both sides of the ratio, so it reports how
well the pool is deduplicating. On a label set worth interning it reads near 100% and stays
there no matter what the labels cost the server.

`storageSavedPct` adds the slot that every reference occupies to both sides. That slot exists
whether or not the bytes behind it are shared, so it cancels out of the saving but belongs in
the total — which makes this the figure to quote for how much memory interning saves overall.
It is the lower of the two, by a margin that grows as the pool deduplicates better. Measured on
a 121k-series Kubernetes-shaped label set, `memorySavedPct` reads 99.2% and `storageSavedPct`
82.1%.

For capacity planning, `storageSavedPct` is still a slight over-statement of what a series
saves: the pool cannot see the per-series container holding those slots, and it counts
short-lived references alongside stored ones. `TS.INFO`'s `memoryUsage` already amortizes the
pool across the series that share it.

#### TopKEntry fields

Each `TopKEntry` is a map of 4 fields:

| Field       | Type    | Description                                                        |
|-------------|---------|--------------------------------------------------------------------|
| `value`     | string  | The interned string value                                          |
| `refCount`  | integer | Number of external references (excluding the pool's own reference) |
| `bytes`     | integer | Logical byte length of the string                                  |
| `allocated` | integer | Total allocated memory for this string (Arc overhead + data)       |

#### With `CLUSTER`

Each node has its own pool, and replicas are left out because they mirror their primary's
labels. The reply has the same shape as on a single node, with these meanings:

- Counts, bytes and allocations are summed, so a string held by three primaries counts three
  times. `allocated` and `totalStorageBytes` are what the cluster spends on interned strings.
- `ByRefcount` buckets are keyed by each node's *local* reference count.
- `memorySavedPct` and `storageSavedPct` are recomputed from the summed byte counts.
- Top-K lists merge each primary's own top K by value, adding up `refCount` and `allocated`.
  `TopKBySize` is exact. `TopKByRef` is approximate: a string just below the cut on every node
  can be missing, and a listed string's `refCount` omits the nodes where it fell below the cut.

### Examples

Basic statistics (no top-K):

```
TS._DEBUG STRINGPOOLSTATS
```

Statistics with top 10 strings by ref count and size:

```aiignore
TS._DEBUG STRINGPOOLSTATS 10
```

The same, summed over the cluster's shard primaries:

```aiignore
TS._DEBUG STRINGPOOLSTATS 10 CLUSTER
```

---

### TS._DEBUG LIST_CONFIGS

Lists the module's configuration parameters. In compact mode (default), returns only parameter names. In verbose mode,
returns detailed metadata and the current runtime value for each parameter.

### Syntax

```bash
TS._DEBUG LIST_CONFIGS [VERBOSE]
```

### Arguments

| Argument  | Required | Description                                                                  |
|-----------|----------|------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| `VERBOSE` | No       | When present, includes metadata and current values for each config parameter |

### Return Value

**Without `VERBOSE`:** A flat array of configuration parameter name strings.

**With `VERBOSE`:** An array with one map of 8 fields per parameter:

| Field     | Type   | Description                                                     |
|-----------|--------|-----------------------------------------------------------------|
| `name`    | string | Configuration parameter name                                    |
| `type`    | string | Value type: `integer`, `float`, `boolean`, `string`, `duration`, or `enum` |
| `default` | varies | Default value for the parameter                                 |
| `min`     | varies | Minimum allowed value, or `"none"` if unbounded                 |
| `max`     | varies | Maximum allowed value, or `"none"` if unbounded                 |
| `value`   | varies | Current runtime value                                           |
| `description` | string | What the parameter controls                                 |
