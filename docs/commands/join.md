Join 2 time series on sample timestamps. Performs an INNER join by default.

[Examples](#examples)

## Required arguments

<details open><summary><code>leftKey</code></summary>

is key name for the time series being joined.
</details>

<details open><summary><code>rightKey</code></summary> 

is key name for time series.
</details>

Both keys must have been created before `TS.JOIN` is called.

<details open><summary><code>fromTimestamp</code></summary>

`fromTimestamp` is the first timestamp or relative delta from the current time of the request range.

</details>

<details open><summary><code>toTimestamp</code></summary>

`toTimestamp` is the last timestamp of the requested range, or a relative delta from `fromTimestamp`
 
</details>



## Optional arguments

<details open><summary><code>LEFT [EXCLUSIVE]</code></summary>

A `LEFT` join outputs the matching samples between both tables. In case no samples match from the left series, it returns 
those items with null values.

A `LEFT EXCLUSIVE` join returns samples for which no corresponding timestamp exists in the `right` series.

</details>

<details open><summary><code>RIGHT [EXCLUSIVE]</code></summary>

A `RIGHT` join outputs all samples in the right series. In case no samples match from the left series, it returns
those items with null values.

`RIGHT EXCLUSIVE` join returns samples for which no corresponding timestamp exists in the `left` series.

</details>

<details open><summary><code>INNER</code></summary>

specifies an `INNER` join. A row is generated for samples with matching timestamps in the selected range.

</details>

<details open><summary><code>FULL</code></summary>

specifies an FULL join. Returns samples from both left and right series. If no matching rows exist for the row in the left 
series, the value of the right series will have nulls. Correspondingly, the value of the left series will have nulls if 
there are no matching rows for the sample in the right series.

</details>

<details open><summary><code>ASOF [PREVIOUS | NEXT | NEAREST] tolerance</code></summary>

`ASOF` joins match each sample in the left series with the closest preceding or following sample in the right series based on 
timestamps. They are particularly useful for analyzing time-series data where records from different sources may not have 
perfectly aligned timestamps. ASOF joins solve the problem of finding the value of a varying property at a specific point in time.

#### How It Works
For each sample in the left table, the join finds the closest matching value from the right table.
- `PREVIOUS` selects the last row in the right series whose timeseries is less than or equal to the left’s timestamp.
- `NEXT` (default) selects the first row in the right series whose timestamp is greater than or equal to the left’s timestamp.
- `NEAREST` selects the last row in the right series whose timestamp is nearest to the left’s timestamp.

`tolerance` sets a limit on how far apart the timestamps can be while still considering them a match. 
The tolerance can be specified as:
 - An integer representing milliseconds
 - A duration specified as a string, e.g. 2m

If not specified, there is no tolerance limit (equivalent to an infinite tolerance). When set, JOIN ASOF will only match 
keys within the specified tolerance range. Any potential matches outside this range will be treated as no match.

The tolerance works in conjunction with the 'direction' parameter. 
 - For example, with strategy = `PREVIOUS` (the default), it looks for the nearest timestamp within the tolerance range that is less 
 than or equal to the timestamp of the left sample.


#### Example
Suppose we want to get the spreads between buy and sell trades in a trading application

```
TS.JOIN trades:buy trades:sell -1hr * ASOF NEAREST 2ms REDUCE sub
```

The result has all samples from the `buy` series joined with samples from the `sell` series. For each timestamp from the 
`buy` series, the query looks for a timestamp that nearest to it from the `sell` series, within a tolerance of
2 milliseconds. If no matching timestamp is found, NULL is inserted.

The `sub` transform function is then supplied to subtract the `sell` value from the `buy` value for each sample returned.

The tolerance parameter is particularly useful when working with time series data where exact matches are rare, but you 
want to find the closest match within a reasonable time frame. 

It helps prevent incorrect matches that might occur if the nearest available data point is too far away in time or value.

</details>

<details open><summary><code>COUNT count</code></summary>

the maximum number of samples to return. 
TODO: if used with aggregation, this specifies the number of returned buckets as opposed to the number of samples

</details>

<details open><summary><code>operator</code></summary> 

performs an operation on the value in each returned row.

 `operator` takes one of the following types:

  | `operator`   | Description                                                             |

  | `and`        | Returns `left` if either value is NAN, `right` otherwise                |
  | `avg`        | Arithmetic mean of both mut values                                      |
