///         - sample_len: length of the time-series in timesteps. Default is 1000.
///         - tau: delay of the MG - system. Commonly used values are tau=17 (mild

///         - seed: to seed the random generator, can be used to generate the same
///           timeseries at each invocation.
///         - n_samples : number of samples to generate
