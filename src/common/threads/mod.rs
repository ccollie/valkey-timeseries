//! The module's threads and thread pools, and the rules that keep them from deadlocking.
//!
//! # Threads
//!
//! | Kind ([`ThreadRole`]) | What | May block | May take the GIL |
//! |---|---|---|---|
//! | `Main` | the server's main thread: commands, callbacks, the cron | no | holds it |
//! | `Blocking` | [`BoundedExecutor`] lanes (fan-out, `TS.OUTLIERS`), [`spawn_background`] tasks | yes | yes |
//! | `SharedPool` | orx-parallel's rayon-core pool, sized by `ts-num-threads` ([`init_thread_pool`]) | no | no |
//! | `BlockingPool` | a pinned pool whose jobs wait for a blocking thread's answer | on blocking threads | no |
//! | `IsolatedPool` | a pinned pool whose jobs never block | no | no |
//!
//! The two pinned kinds are for features that need a pool of their own; this module states
//! the rules for them so that a feature adds a pool, not a rule.
//!
//! One pool sits outside the table: rayon's global pool, which third-party crates enter on
//! their own (`krcf`, behind `TS.OUTLIERS METHOD rcf`, when its parallel heuristic fires). The
//! module never submits work to it, and the jobs it runs there neither block nor take the GIL,
//! so it obeys R1 without exception and any thread, a GIL holder included, may wait on it. It
//! is sized by rayon, not by `ts-num-threads`. Keep it that way: a crate that could block or
//! take the GIL inside its parallel iterators must not be called with the GIL held.
//!
//! # Rules
//!
//! A rayon worker that waits — on a `join`, a scope, a parallel iterator — runs other jobs of
//! its pool while it waits, and a pool whose workers are all parked runs nothing. Every
//! freeze this module has had came from one of those two facts meeting the GIL.
//!
//! - **R1.** A pool job never takes the GIL, and never blocks on anything but jobs of its own
//!   pool. A blocking pool is the one exception: its jobs wait on blocking threads. Its
//!   `join` and `*_rayon` work still steals while it waits, by design: that work stays on the
//!   pool (R4).
//!
//!   Waiting for a data lock is allowed, not an exception, as long as R5 holds for it. A
//!   shared-pool job that reads an index's postings (`TS.LABELSTATS` does) may wait for a writer
//!   to finish: index updates, the stale-id sweep, `optimize_indices`. Those writers hold the
//!   postings lock for one bounded batch, and never wait on a pool or take the GIL while they
//!   hold it, so the wait always ends. `std`'s `RwLock` also queues a new reader behind a
//!   waiting writer, so a GIL holder that waits on such jobs can stall for one writer batch.
//! - **R2.** A GIL holder waits only on a pool that obeys R1 without exception: the shared pool
//!   or an isolated pool, never a blocking pool.
//! - **R3.** Only blocking threads and blocking-pool workers wait for another thread's answer,
//!   and never while holding the GIL: whoever answers may need it.
//! - **R4.** Parallel work started on a pinned worker stays on its pool. Enter parallel work
//!   through the `*_rayon` adapters and [`join`], which pick the pool by role — never the bare
//!   orx or rayon entry points, which would move a blocking pool's jobs onto the pool GIL
//!   holders wait on.
//! - **R5.** No lock guard — the GIL, an index's postings, a series — is held across a wait on
//!   a pool, except the GIL where R2 allows it. Nor is the postings write lock held while
//!   taking the GIL: the order is always GIL, then postings. That is what keeps R1's lock waits
//!   finite.
//!
//! Work that takes the GIL or blocks therefore runs on a blocking thread: a [`BoundedExecutor`]
//! lane for per-request work (bounded queue, refused when full — reserve with
//! [`BoundedExecutor::try_reserve`] before blocking a client), [`spawn_background`] for one-shot
//! work, [`spawn_background_single`] for a periodic task.
//!
//! # Enforcement
//!
//! `clippy.toml` forbids the raw pool and GIL entry points outside this module. At runtime,
//! [`LockGil::lock_gil`] (and [`GilToken::take`], for other guards over the lock) checks R1 and
//! re-entry, [`check_may_wait_on_blocking_pool`] R2 and [`check_may_block`] R3, in release
//! builds too: a debug build panics, a release build logs the first violation of each rule
//! with a backtrace. R4 holds by construction; R5 is for review.

// The raw pool and GIL entry points that `clippy.toml` forbids elsewhere are wrapped here.
